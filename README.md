What is it all about?

There are three folders here:

-> linuxkernel: This contains the modified linux kernel adapted to PodArch.

-> toolchain: This contains the application toolchain that is used to convert regular applications to pod-enabled applications.

-> podarch-QEMU: This contains PodArch-QEMU built on the top of x86-64.
	You'll need a disk image to run PodArch-QEMU on. Download it from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-_JHxVSr437dE5rVnprUDl3RjA&authuser=0
