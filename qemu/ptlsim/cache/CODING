A Simple guideline for coding for new cache structures in MPtlsim:

1.
Names for Class, Struct, or representing any types must be in mixed case
starting with upper case and no '_' in name. For example:
	class Cache
	struct GlobalQueue

2.
Variable names must be in mixed case starting with lower case and no '_' in
name. For example:
	int cacheLineSize;
	double cacheLinePower;

3.
Constant names must be in all upper case using '_' for seperation. For example:
	const int MAX_ASSOC = 4;
	const int L2_LINE_SIZE = 64;

4.
Function names must use '_' for separation with all lower case if possible. For
example:
	int get_length();
	void set_length(int length);

5.
Private class variables must have '_' suffix for easy separation between local
variables and class variables. For example:
	int lineLength_;
	int assoc_;

6.
Avoid unnecessary abbreviation of names when full name can be used. For example:
	do not use -
		int getLineLen();
	instead use -
		int getLineLength();
For representing 'number', one can use 'no' or 'No' as suffix not as prefix.
For example:
	do not use -
		int getLineNumber();
	can be written as -
		int getLineNo();

7.
Whenever possible generic values should have the same name as their type. For
example:
	void setLine(CacheLine* cacheLine);
	void setMemoryHierarchy(MemoryHierarchy* memoryHierarchy);

8.
For access of private variables use 'get', 'set'. And write all getters/setters
into the class definition so they will be treated as 'inline' by compiler.

9.
For boolean variables of class use 'is' as prefix. For example:
	isSet, isFound, isWaiting
Reason for this 'is' prefix is, it forces the programmer to choose meaningful
names instead of just 'isFlag' that doesn't make any sense.

10.
Enumeration constants should be prefixed by a common type name. For example:
	enum LineStatus {
		LINE_STATUS_CACHE_ACCESS,
		LINE_STATUS_WAITING_PORT,
		LINE_STATUS_WAITING_INTERCONNECT,
		LINE_STATUS_WAITING_RESPONSE,
	};

11.
Opening bracket for class/function must be started in next line. For example:
	do not use -
		class Cache {
	instead use -
		class Cache
		{

12.
Opening bracket for loops/conditions like 'if/for/while/switch' should start in
same line. For example:
	if(line != NULL) {

13.
Any line should not exceed a width of 80 characters. Please follow this
strictly as the code gets unreadable if its really long in just one line. For
vim users, to automatically enforce line width to 80 characters add following
line to your .vimrc
	set textwidth=79
